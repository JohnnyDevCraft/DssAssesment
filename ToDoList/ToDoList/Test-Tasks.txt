Make the following changes to the solution:
1.       Add a CompletedAt column to the Tasks table to track when a task is completed in datetime format.
2.       Update the solution to display a CompletedAt column in the Task List view.
3.       Allow users to select a category for each task. Examples could include home, work, and hobby. The category selection should be available on the Create and Edit views.
4.       Display the Task Category name on the Task List view.
5.       Implement a client-side (e.g. javascript) sort feature on the Task List view and allow sorting on Due Date and Priority.
6.       Implement a client-side feature on the List view such that only incomplete tasks display by default, but the user can choose to display all tasks.
 
Optional updates:
1.       Implement a cancel feature that allows the user to cancel a Task and store a cancellation reason in the database. Cancelled tasks should not be listed by default on the Tasks view.
